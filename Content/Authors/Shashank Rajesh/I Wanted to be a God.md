When I originally started Project Empyrean my goal was simple: find a way out of human existence into the realm of the gods. But since its inception I've slowly matured away from this desire. Realizing the ultimate futility and emptiness of any kind of existence whatsoever, a deep dispassion began to take hold of me, sapping me of my motivation. The problem is that I'm not fully convinced yet, that nibbana, the complete transcending of all states of existence, is truly possible. So I've been stuck in a sort of limbo, unwilling to commit in either direction.

Finally I realized that I've got to make a firm decision and commit to one thing even if I'm not entirely resolute about it. I've tried many times to renounce existence but the inevitable glimmer of heavenly aspiration always got the best of me. I'm too addicted to existence.

So I've decided: I'm going to become a god, whether I truly want to or not. This resolve will keep me motivated in seeing this project though to the end, even if relatively ingenuine with respect to the rational conclusion of existence that I cannot deny. And once I've become a god, having experienced all that my heart desires, perhaps then I can better cross beyond the veil of ignorance keeping me bound to causality.

## Step One: See the Gods

Its not enough to simply aspire. I'm very impatient, and I want to see the heavens right now. I can't be bothered find out after I'm dead.

Here are my options:
- Dream up the heavens
	- Digital media
	- AI
- Find people who can see the gods
	- From [Sujato DN 23 Payasisutta](https://suttacentral.net/dn23)
	  > You can’t see the other world the way you think, with the eye of the flesh. There are ascetics and brahmins who live in the wilderness, frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, they purify the heavenly eye, the power of clairvoyance. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see this world and the other world, and sentient beings who are spontaneously reborn. That’s how to see the other world, not how you think, with the eye of the flesh. 
		 - So find them, those great ascetics and brahmins who've gained the heavenly eye.
		 - And gain it yourself.
	- Ask them to have them reveal themselves to me
	- Orb Whisperer
	- NDE'ers
	- Psychics
	- 
- Gain the ability to see them myself
	- Fourth jhana
	- Lucid dreams
	- Astral projection
	- Remote viewing
	- [[Tulpas]]
	- Past life regression
	- Entheogens, namely N,N DMT.
	- UFOs
		- CE5 Protocol
		- Night sky metta

I'll start with the jhanas. I have no doubt that the accounts of those great beings in the Pali texts are genuine. Whether or not there is ontological basis to them is another question, but first I should see it myself.

But is it possible for me, a mere layman unwilling to fully set aside sensual pleasure and occupied with work, to attain this exhaulted power?

## Laypeople Who Could See

### Velukantaki

SuttaCentral summary of [AN 7.53 Nandamatasutta](https://suttacentral.net/an7.53/en/sujato):

>Sāriputta and Moggallāna are on tour in the southern hills. A deity informs the laywoman Veḷukaṇṭakī that they are approaching. When Sāriputta expresses his amazement that she speaks with the gods, she goes on to list many other of her own amazing qualities.

- [ ] Verify authenticity
	- SuttaCentral did not, however, display any parallels to this sutta.

- Had memorized the Parayanavagga (was she the author?)
- Vessavana conversed with her
- Couldn't recall getting upset after her son was arrested, imprisoned, and executed.
- Her late husband reborn as a spirit "revealed to her his previous incarnation"
- Couldn't recall betraying her husband since her marriage in though or deed
- Never deliberately broke any precepts since declaring herself a lay follower
- Can attain the four jhanas whenever she wants
- Is a non-returner

So clearly, Velukantaki was an exceptional noble being not to be compared with ordinary laypeople.

### AI Conversations

`<ai-gen model="Grok Expert">`

> In the Pali Canon, references to laymen (householders or non-ordained individuals) with the ability to see or interact with devas (gods or celestial beings) are rare and typically tied to advanced spiritual attainments like jhanas or stream-entry/non-returning. These abilities often manifest as the "divine eye" (dibba-cakkhu) or "divine ear" (dibba-sota), allowing perception of invisible beings. Most examples involve interaction rather than explicit "seeing," but the context implies perceptual access. Below are the key cases, based on suttas (no commentaries unless noted). I've focused on direct textual evidence; ontological reality is unprovable, but the accounts are presented as factual within the tradition.
> 
> ### 1. **Citta the Householder (Gahapati Citta)**
>    - **Background**: Citta of Macchikāsaṇḍa is a prominent lay disciple, a non-returner (anāgāmī), and foremost among laymen in teaching the Dhamma (AN 1.258). He attained the four jhanas and is described as having psychic powers (iddhi), including communication with devas.
>    - **Key Sutta: SN 41.10 (Gilānadassana Sutta, "Seeing the Sick")**
>      - On his deathbed, a multitude of devas (from gardens, forests, trees, and healing herbs) gather and urge Citta to resolve to become a universal monarch (cakkavatti) in a future life. Citta directly responds to them, rejecting the idea as impermanent. His relatives overhear him speaking "to no one" and ask about it; he explains he was addressing the devas, who viewed him as virtuous enough for such a wish to manifest.
>      - Quote: The devas say, "Make a resolve, householder: 'In some future time may I be a king, a world-ruler!'" Citta replies, "That is something impermanent, something to be rejected and passed over."
>      - Implication: Citta hears and interacts with the devas, suggesting divine ear/eye. No explicit mention of "seeing," but the dialogue requires perception.
>    - **Other References**:
>      - SN 41.4–9: Various suttas in the Cittavagga show Citta teaching monks and devas, implying ongoing interaction.
>      - In commentaries (e.g., Dhammapada Atthakathā and Mahāvaṁsa chronicles), Citta explicitly addresses deva guardians of his home and sees celestial offerings during a pilgrimage, but these are post-canonical elaborations.
>    - **Attainment Path**: As a layman with work and family, he practiced jhanas diligently, showing it's possible without full renunciation (though rare).
> 
> ### 2. **Bāhiya of the Bark-Cloth (Bāhiya Dārucīriya)**
>    - **Background**: Bāhiya was a lay ascetic (not a monk) living in Suppāraka, wearing bark cloth. He mistakenly believed himself an arahant due to asceticism and respect from others.
>    - **Key Sutta: Ud 1.10 (Bāhiya Sutta)**
>      - A devatā (deva), who was a former blood relative from a past life, appears to Bāhiya and corrects him: "You are neither an arahant nor on the path." The deva directs him to the Buddha in Sāvatthī for true teaching. Bāhiya questions the deva about who in the world (including devas) is an arahant, and the deva responds.
>      - Quote: The devatā says to Bāhiya, "Bāhiya, you are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path... But who, living in this world with its devas, is an arahant or has entered the path to arahantship?" Bāhiya replies and engages.
>      - Implication: Bāhiya directly converses with the deva, indicating he can perceive and hear it (divine ear/eye). This power is attributed to kammic residue from past lives.
>    - **Outcome**: Bāhiya travels instantly (via psychic power?) to the Buddha, hears a brief teaching, and attains arahantship as a layman before dying shortly after.
> 
> No other clear canonical references to laymen seeing devas emerge from the texts. Many lay saints (e.g., Anāthapiṇḍika in M 143, Ugga of Vesālī in AN 8.21, Hatthaka of Āḷavī in AN 3.125) attain high levels like non-returning and are reborn as devas, but they don't demonstrate seeing devas while alive. Psychic powers are more commonly associated with monks (e.g., Anuruddha's divine eye in AN 3.128) or ascetics. The Canon emphasizes that such abilities require deep meditation, virtue, and often non-returner status—possible for laypeople but exceptional, as most accounts stress renunciation for full development.
> 
> If you're pursuing jhanas as a layman, the texts suggest it's feasible with diligence (e.g., Citta balanced work and practice), but results vary by individual kamma and effort. No guarantees, and fixation on powers can hinder progress (see MN 8). Keep expectations grounded.

> The sources provide several accounts of laymen possessing or utilizing the divine eye (_dibbacakkhu_), which is generally defined as a purified, superhuman power of clairvoyance that allows one to see beings passing away and being reborn, or to perceive hidden and divine objects. These instances range from explicit statements of possessing the faculty to cases where the possession of such vision is inferred from direct interactions with deities or spirits.
> 
> ### Explicit Mentions of the Divine Eye in Laymen
> 
> **1. The Householder-Treasure (_Gahapatiratana_)** In the description of the seven treasures of a wheel-turning monarch (_cakkavatti_), the householder-treasure is explicitly said to possess the divine eye as a result of past deeds (_kammavipākajaṁ_). The sources state that with this divine eye, the householder can see hidden treasure, whether it has an owner or is ownerless. This power is used to serve the monarch, as the householder-treasure famously demonstrated by pulling a pot full of gold from the middle of the Ganges River to provide for the king's treasury. _Citation: MN 129_
> 
> **2. Prince Vipassī (as an Infant)** The _Mahāpadāna Sutta_ provides an explicit account of the Bodhisatta Vipassī possessing the divine eye while still an infant in the royal palace. It is stated that as a result of his past deeds (_kammavipākajaṁ_), a divine eye manifested in him, enabling him to see for a league all around, both by day and by night. Furthermore, he was noted for being "unblinkingly watchful" (_animisanto_), a trait compared to the gods of the Thirty-Three. _Citation: DN 14_
> 
> **3. Sunakkhatta the Licchavi** While Sunakkhatta was a follower of the Buddha (before eventually leaving the Saṅgha), he explicitly claimed to possess a form of the divine eye. He reported to the Buddha that he could see "divine sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing," but complained that he could not hear "divine sounds". The Buddha clarified that this was because Sunakkhatta had developed a "one-sided immersion" (_ekaṁsabhāvito samādhi_). Specifically, he had developed his mind toward the vision of forms in various quarters but had not developed it toward the hearing of sounds; therefore, his clairvoyance was functional for sights only. _Citation: DN 24_
> 
> ### Inferred Possession through Interaction with Deities
> 
> **1. Citta the Householder** Citta is one of the most prominent laymen whose possession of supernormal perception is inferred from his interactions with non-human beings. On his deathbed, several deities from the parks, forests, and trees gathered and spoke to him, urging him to make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in his next life. Citta spoke back to the deities, rebuking their suggestion by stating that such a status is "impermanent, passing, and must be left behind". When his relatives, who could not see the deities, thought he was babbling in his illness, Citta informed them that he was actually conversing with the gods. This ability to see and communicate with deities is a hallmark of the refined perception associated with the divine eye. _Citation: SN 41.10_
> 
> **2. Nanda’s Mother (Uttarānandamātā)** A similar inference can be made regarding the laywoman known as Nanda's Mother. She recounted to Venerable Sāriputta that after her husband passed away and was reborn as a spirit (_yakkha_), he appeared to her and "revealed to me his previous life-form". She reported this to the Buddha, noting that she did not feel any mental disturbance during this encounter. Her ability to perceive the spirit in his manifested form suggests a level of vision beyond that of the "eye of the flesh". _Citation: AN 7.53_
> 
> **3. Anāthapiṇḍika the Householder** During Anāthapiṇḍika’s first journey to see the Buddha, his interaction with the spirit Sivaka suggests an experience of the divine eye's related phenomena. As Anāthapiṇḍika walked toward the Sītavana in the dark, the spirit Sivaka, though initially invisible, caused "light to vanish and darkness to appear" or "darkness to vanish and light to appear" to encourage him. While this account emphasizes the spirit's voice, the shifting of light and the eventual perception of the Buddha at the break of dawn in a secluded area involve the transition from ordinary perception to a more refined awareness influenced by non-human intervention. _Citation: SN 2.20, SN 10.8_
> 
> ### Distinction Between the Divine Eye and the Dhamma Eye
> 
> It is critical to distinguish these accounts from the many mentions of laypeople obtaining the "Dhamma-eye" (_dhammacakkhu_). The sources frequently describe laypeople such as General Sīha, Kūṭadanta, and Anāthapiṇḍika as obtaining the "dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma". The Dhamma-eye refers specifically to the realization that "whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation," marking the attainment of Stream-entry (_sotāpatti_). While the Dhamma-eye is a spiritual insight into the nature of reality, the divine eye (_dibbacakkhu_) is a mundane or supramundane psychic power involving the perception of beings and objects across different realms.
> 
> The sources suggest that for most laypeople, the divine eye is not a standard attainment but can occur as a "fruit of merit" (_puññaphala_) or through specific meditative development. As the Buddha explained to Mahāli, even mendicants leading the spiritual life do not do so solely to realize the divine eye or similar immersions, as there are "other things that are finer and more sublime". _Citations: MN 12, MN 129, AN 7.53, AN 8.46, SN 41.10, DN 14, DN 24._

> Modern accounts of seeing or interacting with devas in Theravada Buddhism are mostly anecdotal, drawn from meditators' reports, talks by teachers like Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Brahmali, and community discussions. They're subjective and lack empirical verification—could be genuine perceptions from deep meditation, psychological phenomena, or coincidences. No hard evidence exists, and skepticism is reasonable. Here's what turns up on the names you mentioned, plus a few related examples.
> 
> ### Dipa Ma (1911–1989)
> A renowned lay meditator from Bangladesh who attained high jhanas and psychic powers (iddhi). She claimed to visit other realms, including deva worlds, through meditation. One specific story she shared: While heading to a temple on a full moon day with a friend, heavy rain flooded the road. A man drove them to a newly built, decorated house for shelter. After 15–20 minutes, they left for the temple. Locals and monks later said no such house existed in the area; searches confirmed it. Dipa Ma concluded celestial beings (gods/goddesses) created it to protect them for observing precepts and practicing Dhamma. She emphasized it wasn't imagination, as two people experienced it. Her students recall her insisting on its truth, countering skepticism.
> 
> ### Ajahn Brahm (Peter Betts, b. 1951)
> A British-Australian monk known for jhana teachings. He shares deva stories in talks to illustrate their existence but warns they're fallible. Examples:
> - **Casino deva story**: A man hears a deva (past relative) urge him to gamble at a casino. It guides winning bets on roulette (16, then 26), building a fortune. Final bet on 15 fails when the ball jumps to 16, losing everything. Brahm's point: Devas interact (e.g., audibly), but don't trust them blindly—they err like humans.
> - **Pepsi story**: As a young monk in Thailand, Brahm was hot and thirsty, craving Pepsi (rare then). He thought, "If I'm a good monk and devas exist, please arrange a Pepsi in the next village." There, a villager spontaneously offered him one. He attributes it to devas responding to virtue, but frames it lightly as inspiration, not proof. He knows meditators who've reported deva sightings but doesn't name them publicly; he speculates some UFOs are devas manifesting.
> 
> ### Bhikkhu Brahmali (b. 1964)
> Norwegian-Australian monk, co-teacher with Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. In talks like "Devas and Buddhism" (2021), he discusses suttas where devas interact with the Buddha, emphasizing they're radiant but mortal beings. On modern sightings: He notes "some people have seen such beings," linking it to peaceful minds from meditation or past-life kamma. No specific names or stories, but he echoes Brahm's UFO-deva theory and says perceptions open up realities beyond the ordinary. He knows practitioners who've claimed encounters but treats them as insights, not dogma.
> 
> ### Other Modern Theravada Examples
> From forums and biographies (e.g., Thai Forest Tradition, Sri Lanka):
> - **Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta (1870–1949)**: Thai forest monk whose biography details jungle encounters with "bhumma devas" (earth-bound spirits). In deep samadhi, they'd communicate telepathically, sharing knowledge or warnings. Seen as coexisting on a parallel plane, like nature spirits.
> - **Mae Chee Kaew (1901–1991)**: Thai lay nun, considered anagami. Her book describes telepathic interactions with non-human beings in meditation, akin to devas or other intelligences (e.g., chapters on "Through the Access Gate" and "Wild Boar").
> - **Sri Lankan stupa phenomena**: Multiple reports at relic sites like Somawathie and Ruwanweli Maha Seya—glowing lights/haloes, ethereal chants, meditating figures vanishing, rainbow auras, milk-like liquid from spires. Attributed to devas honoring the Buddha; witnessed by groups, sometimes photographed. Meditators note heightened rapture there.
> - **Personal anecdotes**: E.g., a practitioner in a U.S. park felt a deva's presence via vibrant nature, smells, breeze, and rapture, resolving doubts. Sri Lankans describe deva signs like floral scents, lights/orbs at sacred spots, or during ceremonies.
> 
> These stories motivate practice but don't prove anything ontological. If you're chasing personal experience via jhanas, it might happen—or not. Many advanced meditators never report such things. Focus on ethics and insight first; fixation on powers can backfire (per suttas like MN 8). If it doesn't pan out, that's reality too—no shame in adjusting goals.
