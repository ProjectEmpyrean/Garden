Happiness is not feeling bad. Whatever one feels bad about must be felt as unpleasant. Whatever one feels good about must be felt as not unpleasant.

It should be noted, however, that it is possible to appear to feel good about something unpleasant, but in this case, one doesn't actually *feel* the displeasure significantly. Instead, they feel good about a not unpleasant perception about that displeasure.

So ultimately, happiness is *not feeling* displeasure beyond a [[Threshold|threshold]].
