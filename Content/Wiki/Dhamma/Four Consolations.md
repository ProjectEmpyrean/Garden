From [AN 3.65 Kesamuttisutta](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/en/sujato#43.2):

> When that noble disciple has a mind that's free of enmity and ill will, uncorrupted and purified, they've won four consolations in this very life.
>
> 'If it turns out there is another world, and good and bad deeds have a result, then---when the body breaks up, after death---I'll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.' This is the first consolation they've won.
>
> 'If it turns out there is no other world, and good and bad deeds don't have a result, then in this very life I'll keep myself free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy.' This is the second consolation they've won.
>
> 'If it turns out that bad things happen to people who do bad things, then since I have no bad intentions, and since I'm not doing anything bad, how can suffering touch me?' This is the third consolation they've won.
>
> 'If it turns out that bad things don't happen to people who do bad things, then I still see myself pure on both sides.' This is the fourth consolation they've won.
>
> When that noble disciple has a mind that's free of enmity and ill will, undefiled and purified, they've won these four consolations in this very life." (Sujato)

| If karma is true      | 🪦 There is no afterlife | 👻 There is an afterlife |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 😇 Ethical behavior   | 🙂                       | 🤩                       |
| 👿 Unethical behavior | 🙁                       | 😫                       |

One may argue that it is possible to get away with unethical behavior and enjoy the benefits they may bring without suffering the consequences if there is no afterlife. Even in this case, however, one is unable to escape the psychological impact of that behavior unless they are psychopathic, and the risk of getting caught will be an everpresent burden to endure.

But at the end of the day, if you're unsure if there is no afterlife, why take the risk?
