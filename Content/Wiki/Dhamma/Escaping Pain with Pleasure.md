 In [SN 26.6](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.6/en/sujato?lang=en) the Buddha explains the ordinary escape from pain by delighting in pleasure:

> (Of an unlearned ordinary person) When they're touched by painful feeling, they resist it. The underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlies that. When touched by painful feeling they **look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures**. Why is that? Because an unlearned ordinary person **doesn't understand any escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures**. Since they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlies that. (Sujato)
