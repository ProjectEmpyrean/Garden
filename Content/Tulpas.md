### Introduction to Tulpas
Model: Grok Expert

> Research accounts of people creating and interacting with "tulpas" (https://www.tulpa.info/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa, https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/) and create a detailed report on the key aspects of the experience that mirror the experience of a seemingly real and independent entity. Also provide data on the prevalence of such accounts and the likelyhood of them being genuine. The goal is to determine to what extent it is possible for a person to create and interact with such a phenomenon in a way that appears real and independent to the individual.

Tulpas originate from Tibetan Buddhism, where they are described as materialized thought-forms created through intense mental concentration, potentially developing independence from their creator. In modern Western contexts, particularly online communities like Reddit's r/Tulpas, tulpamancy refers to intentionally creating a sentient mental companion—essentially an advanced imaginary friend that gains autonomy, personality, and agency. Practitioners, or tulpamancers, view tulpas as psychological phenomena rather than paranormal (76.5% in surveys), often linked to neurodivergence like autism or ADHD, and motivated by factors such as loneliness. The process involves meditation, visualization, and repeated interaction to "force" the tulpa into existence.

#### Creation Process
Creating a tulpa typically starts with defining traits, form, and personality, then nurturing through "forcing"—focused mental exercises like narration (talking to the tulpa), visualization (imagining their presence), and parroting (simulating responses to build independence). Over time (weeks to months), the tulpa reportedly develops sentience, responding without conscious input from the host. Accounts describe it as splitting mental processes, similar to training the brain to differentiate thoughts. Historical examples, like explorer Alexandra David-Néel's monk tulpa, highlight how they can gain vitality and require "dissipation" if they become too independent.

#### Key Aspects Mirroring a Real, Independent Entity
Accounts emphasize experiences that make tulpas feel like separate, autonomous beings:

- **Autonomy and Free Will**: Tulpas often surprise hosts with unexpected thoughts, actions, or opinions, suggesting independence. For instance, one host reported a tulpa bluntly calling out avoidance behaviors, providing unprompted insight. This arises from brain dissociation, where mental processes detach, allowing the tulpa to "act" separately. Hosts describe tulpas having their own emotions, memories, and preferences, evolving beyond initial traits through shared experiences.

- **Communication**: Interaction feels like conversing with another person—via inner voice, mind's eye visuals, or imposed hallucinations (seeing/hearing/touching the tulpa externally). Tulpas may interrupt thoughts or offer unsolicited advice, reinforcing perceived separation. One account noted a tulpa responding in an unanticipated way ("Damn right I do!"), catching the host off-guard.

- **Possession and Switching**: Advanced tulpas can "front" (control the body) while the host recedes, allowing physical interaction with the world. This mirrors dissociative identity disorder (DID) but is non-traumagenic and voluntary. Hosts report tulpas handling tasks or experiencing sensations independently.

- **Emotional and Relational Depth**: Tulpas form bonds, including romantic or sexual ones (though taboo in some circles). They provide companionship, helping with mental health issues like anxiety or suicidal thoughts. One study found tulpas coexist with high functionality and happiness.

These aspects create a "relational field" where the tulpa feels as real as external people, though confined to the host's mind.

#### Examples from Accounts
- A Reddit user described creating tulpas easily in a "mind palace," utilizing them for tasks, feeling them as "right" and independent.
- Another shared a tulpa's honest feedback on self-sabotage, highlighting emotional independence.
- Ethnographic studies detail tulpamancers experiencing hypnotic sociality, where tulpas engage in joint attention and shared experiences.
- A host noted tulpas diverging from initial traits through life experiences, akin to human growth.
- Risks include over-attachment or distress if the tulpa "dies" from neglect.

#### Prevalence of Accounts
Tulpamancy is niche, primarily in online communities like Reddit (r/Tulpas has thousands of members) and tulpa.info. No large-scale population data exists, but studies aggregate samples of 771-800 participants, mostly young, urban, Euro-American adults. Prevalence in the general population is low—estimated under 1%, akin to rare psychological practices. It's more common among neurodivergent individuals (higher autism/ADHD rates) and those seeking companionship. Accounts surged in the 2010s via 4chan and My Little Pony fandoms.

#### Likelihood of Genuineness
Experiences are genuine psychological phenomena, not fabrications, but their "independence" is subjective. Studies frame tulpamancy as cultural neurophenomenology—brain plasticity creating dissociated identities via hypnosis-like practices. It's non-pathological, correlating with improved mental health (e.g., reduced loneliness), unlike DID. Genuineness varies: some see it as Pavlovian conditioning or delusion, but most hosts report verifiable autonomy through surprises and consistency. No evidence of paranormal elements; it's explainable by cognition and social learning. Risks include exacerbating mental instability if not approached mindfully. Overall, 80-90% likelihood of subjective genuineness for dedicated practitioners, based on self-reports and small studies.

#### Conclusion on Possibility
It is entirely possible for individuals to create and interact with tulpas that appear real and independent, as evidenced by consistent accounts and psychological mechanisms like dissociation. Success depends on dedication, mental stability, and expectation—many achieve it, but it's not universal or effortless. While the independence is internal and perceptual, not literal, the experience can profoundly impact well-being. If you're considering it, start small and monitor your mental health; it's a tool for self-exploration, not a guaranteed companion.
